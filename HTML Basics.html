<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road</cite>.</p>
<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an <em>Oscar Wilde</em> quote proclaiming  that, &quot;Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do&quot. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the Ilama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"> DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
